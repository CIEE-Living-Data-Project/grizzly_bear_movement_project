# grizzly_bear_movement_project
LDP Mini Project analyzing grizzly bear movement data from Ladle et al. 2018

This project analyzes data collected by Ladle et al. (2018) on grizzly bear movement in recreated areas in southern Alberta. Data were analyzed in the Ladle et al. (2018) manuscript. This project involves additional analyses, independent of the existing 2018 paper. 

This is a mini project for an LDP course taken in Fall 2022. It includes folders for scripts, outputs, data (raw and clean) and the manuscript associated with this project.
